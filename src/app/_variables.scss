// @todo Disclaimer: This is not the way I normally do this. Most of this is the shame.scss partial (worth explaining,
// shame.scss is a good practice), but since we don't have a CSS framework, I put it just here.

// Global.
$global-margin: 1rem;

// Grid. (Which @todo could be implemented, for now, just separating some variables.)
$gutter: $global-margin;

// Typography.
$base-font-family: Arial;

// Colors.
$gray-color: #808080;
$accent-color: #f9d649;
$error-color: #ff0000;
